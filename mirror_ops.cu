/* Write the code to mirror the image.
   Mirror's orientation can be both horizontal as well as vertical.
   Decide the parameters for yourself and return a pointer to the new image.
   Or maybe, you can deallocate the memory of the incoming image after the operation.

   You will receive a pointer to h_in so tasks like allocating memory 
   to GPU - you need to handle them yourself.
